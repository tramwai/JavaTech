Write a Java program that asks user to enter a number
if number is more than or equal to 10, then finish the program but
if number is less than 10, keep asking user to enter a new number
until user enters a number that is more than or equal to 10

Example program:
Program: Please enter a number
User: 3

Program: This number is not more than or equal to 10
Program: Please enter a new number
User: 8

Program: This number is not more than or equal to 10
Program: Please enter a new number
User: 15

Program: This number is more than or equal to 10
